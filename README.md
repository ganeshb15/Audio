## Audio Processing 

The goal is to continuously add audio processing features as modules whenever they are developed. Currently, two functionalities have been implemented:

1. ![Running](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00FF00/000000?text=+) **AudioDataLength**: This function generates a list of lengths for all audio files within a folder, including the sum of all audio file lengths. It works recursively through all subfolders. The results are saved in a .csv file, which can be used for data analysis and assessment, providing insights into the amount of data available for training purposes.

2. ![Issue](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF0000/000000?text=+) **DataAllIndiaRadio**: This feature aims to automate the process of downloading audio files from All India Radio. However, due to recent changes on their website, this functionality is currently not operational. It will be updated for the new version as needed.

Feel free to use the tools. In case of bugs or improvement aspect feel free to raise an issue or mail me at ganeshbhagwat255@gmail.com. Will respond as soon as possible. All feedback and comments are appreciated.
