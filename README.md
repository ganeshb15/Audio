## Audio Processing 

This is some of the script and function developed while working on a audio processing project.  It's a small contribution from my side. Hope it's helpful.

Feel free to use the tools. In case of bugs or improvement aspect feel free to raise an issue or mail me at ganeshbhagwat255@gmail.com. Will respond as soon as possible. All feedback and comments are appreciated.

The cleaning up part of the algorithum(music seperation and speaker speration) is in paper review state, once accepted and published will upload the code for the same.
